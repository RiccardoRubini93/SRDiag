# SRDiag

Test script delevoped in the early development of the code for the a priori sparsification of reduced order models.
The idea is diagonalise a randomly generated (symmetric) matrix A through the supspace rotation technique.
Solving a convex optimisation problem we look for the rotation matrix X that defines the new basis such that the matrix A is diagonal.
